# Offensive-OSINT-Tools

This repository contains tools and links that can be used during OSINT in Pentest or Red Team. Currently, there are numerous awesome lists with tons of tools, but Offensive Security specialists often don't need such an extensive selection. This motivated the creation of this list. These tools cover almost all the needs of Offensive Security specialists and will help you get the job done efficiently.


If the tool performs multiple functions, for example collecting subdomains **and** URLs, it will be listed in two places.
